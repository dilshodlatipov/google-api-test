# Getting Started

### Note that in this project deleting and updating(you can only update using spreadsheet) objects type of Student wasn't implemented.

In this project in every ten minutes database will be updated accordingly to spreadsheet.
For now, you can update Student table in spreadsheet. In the future, I'll add REST API to update Student table using
their id's.

#### For more explanations read documentation of this project

## You can view the spreadsheet here:

* [Students](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12BLCE2P3WZHsY5XpbsxFhPxZD4J2ZAPRKnRJhVfJod8/edit#gid=0)

And you have to set up [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project there to
get [Credentials](src/main/resources/sheet_credentials.json).

* Go to APIs & Service > Enabled APIs & Services > Enable APIs & Services and enable Google Spreadsheet API.
* Then go to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen and create a web app.
* Then go to APIs & Services > Credentials and create OAuth client ID.

For more information you can search from the internet.
